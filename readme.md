This is a small, fun library of games written in C.  All of the games here should run on almost any system (read: embedded systems with > 1K RAM). I originally wrote these games to run on a small handheld game I made which implements a 21x10 pixel screen using persistence-of-vision and discrete LEDs.

The resolution of all the games is extremely low (on the order of tens of pixels by tens of pixels) so that they can be played on small low-resolution screens.
